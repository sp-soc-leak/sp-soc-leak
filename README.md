## WHO AM I?
I am an account made to leak SOC content from singapore polytechnic from the previous years. Why? This is because the syllabus is somewhat difficult and is known to be not only outdated, but rarely outright wrong. I had teachers saying linux is bad because there is no GUI (not true and wrong for many reasons), code that does not really teach us key features and core to the languages we learn (we don't learn things like the proto chain for nodejs), and this is espcially true for FOC. (Not only are the slides wrong, some of the content in the slides still talk about 32 bit devices being commonplace, despite moving away from it in the mid 2000s (about 2006)).

## Why?
There is very very very little info about previous years and honestly I find that no one can really thrive in these conditions. It's pretty unfair.
